## Work

#### This week, I:

- was the scrum master.
- successfully assigned tasks to members on what functions they have to do.
- research on the UI of extensions. Basically I will research more about this during the reading week.
- was more concerned in leading the team to successfully clone the repository onto their own machines. There was some debugging that Bassil and I had to fix during the entire meeting.

## Meetings

### Meeting Name: Assignment

### Lead by: Beatrice Tan

- Assigned tasks to group members
- Bassil has successfully coded a timer app.
- Each member of the team are required to clone the main repository (Bassil's code) to their own local machine (acquire a copy of the code in their own computer) by the end of the day.
- Identify the MVPs: Start and stop function of the timer was already coded.
- Bassil will only just have to update the clear timer functionality. He did an amazing job on stepping up and creating an initial code for timer/stopwatch for the timesheets
- Beatrice will: research on the UI to how to make the thing look prettier, and how to make it attached on the left. More front-end. Researching more on clockify.
- Anthony will research on how to make things saved on a specific place.
- Ellis is going to research on how to update the timer into the excel sheet
- Rami will research on how to code a copy button and input a textbox to create a "FileName"
- Reached out to members having difficulty with git and being lost with the overall updates of the team. Guided the members for everybody to be on the same page.

## Work

#### This week, I:

Researching on: I am researching on how to add webview. I experimented writing a webview.html, webview.css, and separate webview.js and of course it did not work. So this code is not going to push through.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me

## Meetings

### Meeting Name: Assignment

### Lead by: Rami

- We were doing our own code remotely

# March 15, 2023

## Work

#### This week, I:

- was able to code the GUI however it is not the same as we imagined it to be.
- Researching on: I am researching on how to add webview
  Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/11/webview-ui-toolkit
- I also modified the code in Package.json to add the webview for the TimeCheaters.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me. I am stressing out.

## Meetings

### Meeting Name: Assignment

### Lead by: Bassil

- We were doing our own code remotely. I was doing my experimenting.
- Copy button idea was scrapped

# March 22, 2023

## Work

#### This week, I:

- I personally pushed my code to my own branch and asked feedback for it. The sidebar panel is appearing on the right instead of the left side. I still can't figure out how I can fix that.

## Meetings

### Meeting Name: User Testing

### Lead by: Beatrice

- Beatrice was doing the user-testing to 5 people. Anthony helped Beatrice to user-test, and helped Rami debug his Git connections.
- Ellis and Rami are doing their code.
- Bassil not in class. He doesn't have to.

Blockers: I think there's too much GUI assigned on me.

# March 29, 2023

## Work

#### This week, I:

- studied more of TouchGrass extension's code. I wanted to implement the visuals that the developer has made, with the reset button and touch grass button (except for ours it will be the start button). It was written in typescript. It shouldn't be that far from javascript. Still, everything is making me cross eyed.

## Meetings

### Meeting Name: B&B

### Lead by: Bassil

- Bassil and Beatrice were the only ones who showed up in person.

Blockers: The webview is really frustrating me. Nobody wants me to push my code to main since it's not 100% working with the keyboard functionality.
This workshops is demotivating. I reached out to professors for help. I do not know other professional coders who can do the code.

# April 5, 2023

## Work

#### This week, I:

- considered of coding something else like "did you mean to save this?"
- I replaced (stop --> pause) to avoid confusion to people using the timer. I pushed it to main.

## Meetings

### Meeting Name:

### Lead by: ~

- Bassil and Beatrice were the only ones who showed up in person.
- Ellis was able to finalize his CSV Functionality and pushed his code to main.

Blockers: Still the GUI is a big blocker
