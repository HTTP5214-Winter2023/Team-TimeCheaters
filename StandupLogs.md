## Meetings
### Meeting Name: Assignment
### Lead by: Beatrice Tan
- Assigned tasks to group members
- Bassil has successfully coded a timer app.
- Each member of the team are required to clone the main repository (Bassil's code) to their own local machine (acquire a copy of the code in their own computer) by the end of the day.
- Identify the MVPs: Start and stop function of the timer was already coded. 
- Bassil will only just have to update the clear timer functionality. He did an amazing job on stepping up and creating an initial code for timer/stopwatch for the timesheets
- Beatrice will: research on the UI to how to make the thing look prettier, and how to make it attached on the left. More front-end. Researching more on clockify.
- Anthony will research on how to make things saved on a specific place.
- Ellis is going to research on how to update the timer into the excel sheet
- Rami will research on how to code a copy button and input a textbox to create a "FileName"
- Reached out to members having difficulty with git and being lost with the overall updates of the team. Guided the members for everybody to be on the same page.
